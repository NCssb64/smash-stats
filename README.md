##A Project Intended to Aggregate Glicko Statistics for Smash Bros. Players.

Future Goals:

	1. Scrape the smash.gg api to get tournament results

	2. Make the glicko calculator standalone (maybe a python package?)

	3. Output the results to a csv

	4. Add a predictor for a head to head given current Glicko ratings

	5. Use the predictor to model the likelihood of player X winning tournament Y
